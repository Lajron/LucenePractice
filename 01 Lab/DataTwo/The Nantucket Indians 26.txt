r act and deed, in the presence of the General Court, this 12th
  of June, 1667, as attest.

                                           MATTHEW MAYHEW,
                                       Secretary to the General Court.

It is rather curious that this deed, although duly witnessed on May
10th, 1660, was not confirmed by Peter Folger until January first,
1664, and did not receive official attestation by the Secretary of the
General Court until the 12th of June, 1677.

This deed purchased the island from the original patentee and a greater
part of it from the Indians, and the English are said to have paid £26
for it. Almost a year before the execution of the above deed, however,
what is known as “The First Indian Deed” was executed by Nickanoose and
Nanahuma on June 2
