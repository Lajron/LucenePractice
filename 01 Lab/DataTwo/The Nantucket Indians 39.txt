Why did neither of these sons claim his rights until 1672—a period of
11 years? Was Potconet living in 1661? These questions have still to be
answered, although I have unsuccessfully sought in every direction for
a satisfactory reply.

In the Registry of Nantucket Deeds, under date June 20, 1672, is the
following entry: “Ahkeiman laying claim to part of Tuckanuck his claim
thereto is found no other but as he was a =duke or principal man upon
Nantucket=; the Nantucket Sachems, =together with his father=, having
sold =Tuckanuck=, it is ordered that he shall have such a part or
portion of land for his use at Nantucket of the present Sachems as will
become one of such quality, and a portion of the whales.”
